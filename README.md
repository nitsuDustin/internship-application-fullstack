# Cloudflare Workers Internship Application: Full-Stack

My implementation of the coding challenge satifies the requirements including, making a request to the URL, parsing the response as JSON, and randomly fecthing one of the two URLs from the JSON. This implementation also satifies the first extra credit requirement, which is to change some of the HTML.
